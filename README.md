<h1>YouTube-Clone</h1>



<p>I'm excited to share my YouTube-Clone project, which I developed using React-Vite. This project features four distinct interfaces: Home, Results, Detail, and Undefined, providing a comprehensive user experience. Navigation between these pages is seamless, thanks to the integration of react-router-dom. Additionally, the sidebar parameters are dynamic, allowing you to fetch the latest videos through API requests with each click. </p>
